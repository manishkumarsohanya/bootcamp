Three updates which i want to make in flipkart.com-
1. Air delivery-no doubt flipkart is one of the bigghest online shopping giants of india, but it laggs behind sometimes when it comes to delivery. Air delivery is 
   something which can boost the delivery system of flipkart. Air delivery could be done with the help of drones which is the rapid growing technology now a days.
   Air delivery feature will be added as a extra paid service in the flipkart. User will have to pay when he is ordering something. And he can get his order in 
   short duration of time.

2. Food- Food delivery is the next option i want to add in flipkart. Flipkart has every thing from cloths to household requirements. But, it can earn more if it has food 
   delivery options. People in india love shopping with flipkart but when it comes to ordering food, they look for other websites. What if flipkart itself has food delivery
  option? People rather going to any other website, will order food from flipkart itself. And flipkart can earn with this update.

3. Cashback- Flipkart should have a feature of cashback also. For instance, paytm is offering cashback to every customer whenever they order something. And because of 
   a large number of people are attracted towards paytm. So i want to add this feature to flipkart also. So that rather diverting to other shopping website, people
   will be shopping from flipkart itself. And with the help of that cashback they will only be able to shop from flipkart. So its again a plus for flipkart.
